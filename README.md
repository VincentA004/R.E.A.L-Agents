# R.E.A.L.-Analyst

**R.E.A.L.-Analyst (Real Estate Agentic Layer Analyst)** is an AI-native platform designed to automate and augment real estate market analysis using agent-based collaboration. The system leverages Microsoftâ€™s Azure AI Foundry ecosystem to deliver intelligent, end-to-end insights across property valuation, zoning compliance, market trends, and investment strategy.

The long-term vision is to build a robust, multi-agent system capable of ingesting property documents, integrating with third-party data sources (e.g., RentCast, ATTOM), and autonomously generating professional-grade comparative market analyses (CMAs) and investment reports.

## Phase 1: Foundry SDK MVP (Minimal Viable Prototype)

The current version of the project represents **Phase 1**, a streamlined multi-agent prototype built using the `azure-ai-projects` and `azure-ai-agents` SDKs. Rather than full orchestration, Phase 1 registers supporting agents as callable tools within a primary agent â€” enabling modular, agentic behavior while keeping architecture minimal and developer-friendly.

### Agent Architecture

- **InvestmentAdvisor Agent** (Primary Agent)  
  Handles user interaction and thread management; calls sub-agents via tool usage

- **ValuationAgent** (Sub-agent)  
  Provides property valuation insights

- **ZoningAgent** (Sub-agent)  
  Analyzes zoning rules and regulatory context

### Key Capabilities

- Multi-agent structure via tool-based sub-agent registration  
- Thread-based memory and persistent history via Foundry APIs  
- Early tool usage and response streaming  
- Foundation for full orchestration and autonomy in future phases

## Phase 2: Full Enterprise Agentic Platform (In Progress)

**Phase 2** transforms R.E.A.L.-Analyst into a fully cloud-native, production-grade, enterprise agentic application. It leverages **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service** for hosting, **Semantic Kernel** for rich multi-agent orchestration, and a full Azure-native stack for deployment, storage, memory, and observability.

### Key Architecture Highlights

- **Semantic Kernel Orchestration**  
  Handles complex multi-agent workflows with reasoning, retry logic, tool chaining, and decision delegation.

- **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service**  
  Hosts agents in production with native observability, autoscaling, and memory persistence.

- **Custom Agentic Memory Layer**  
  Built on **Azure Cosmos DB**, organizing memory by user, thread, and agent for deep personalization and multi-turn context.

- **Enterprise Document Intelligence**  
  Powered by **Azure Blob Storage** and Azure AI Search for document ingestion, indexing, and contextual retrieval.

- **Cloud-Native Deployment Infrastructure**  
  The full stack will run on:
  - **Azure Container Service (ACS)** for image lifecycle management
  - **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** for orchestrating scalable, containerized agent workloads

- **Next.js Web Interface (Coming Soon)**  
  A custom, production-ready frontend with authentication, streaming, upload support, and role-based session history â€” replacing the prototype Gradio UI.

- **Multitenant Architecture**  
  Designed to support multiple organizations with isolated threads, memory, and document access per tenant.

This phase aims to deliver an intelligent automation platform for real estate professionals â€” scalable, secure, and extensible by design.
